bugs
----------
discount extra data field initialized with purchased tag
multiplier data field should be item multiplier instead of upgrade count
clicking on button text blocks button press detection
ticker multiplayer upgrade price doesn't work
	ticker adds points when at negative point




balance ideas
---------------
timer should payout way more to balance against autoclickers
is the discount only being 1% off a joke lol 
main multiplier price should be higher
individual multiplier upgrades should be cheaper
bomb shoulr reward more points the quicker you are :3
ticker offset upgrade should be super cheap
expired timers should deduct points
